Question 2)
1.What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
	-Accuracy is increasing when the hidden nodes are increase

2.Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase? 
	-Accuracy is increasing when hidden nodes increase.At a certain point, increasing the number
	 of hidden nodes can lead to overfitting, where the model starts to memorize the training data
	 rather than generalize to new data.
